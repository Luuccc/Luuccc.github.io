							for an update request on startup. On update, the sector containing the current firmware 
							would become the "previous" version, and the update data from the UART would be written 
							to the "current" version sector, after verifying the update checksum the current version 
							is booted into after the bootloader, otherwise the previous sector remains the current sector.

							As it turns out they aren't distributed randomly, they are within any 2-3 character group 
							of brackets, e.g "<1$2>" or "[$4*]". After implementation it made sense, and worked well. 
							There were some improvements to the GUI aswell! Although the endless issues with building 
							my application for Android with the various compatibility issues with the service libraries 
							(required to work with Google Play), then all the fun new policies to work through, which was fine.
							But my work won't see the light of day, as some permission that is now required with 
							Android 13 (and is present within my package), isn't picked up by the Play Console so

						<p>Unfortunately another TV/monitor of mine had given up on me. Upon inspection, I 
							discovered that the TV worked, although the backlight LEDs weren't turning on. I 
							opened up the device to find the single LED that was preventing the others from 
							turning on, sadly these couldn't be replaced but I did find a replaced LED strip.<br><br>
							Tragically the day before the replacement arrived, I had placed the (very fragile) LED display 
							on my workbench, which the adhesive on its back had stuck to.. so naturally upon lifting, it
							developed a fantastic crack and rendered the TV useless...<br><br>
							Meanwhile I had been attempting to repair an old TV of mine which was stuck in a boot loop,
							sadly I learning the common fault is a corrupted flash. Luckily for me, there wasn't 
							a simple firmware update or reset I could, but I did manage to locate the 25Q64C flash chip,
							as well as the TVs firmware in the form of a binary file!!<br><br>
							I tried what felt like hundred of methods to program this IC, from quite a messy surgical 
							operation, attempting to flash using Tera Term with the help of some logic level 
							shifters as the chip can only handle 3.3V. To finally picking up a SOP-8 clip to make my 
							life a little easier, then booted up a Linux distribution and attempted to use <a target="_blank" class="web-link" href="https://flashrom.org/">flashrom</a>,
							which was able to verify the chip!!<br><br>
							At this point I reached some hurdle with Ubuntu (I think it was the number of chip pinouts), 
							so I tried the same thing on a Raspberry Pi, and I actually managed to program this 
							flash with using some binary file I found in an EEPROM forum dump!!!<br><br>
							Unsurprisingly, after all the the work I put into this project, I once again tripped at the last hurdle,
							while resoldering the IC onto the board, I had lifted the solder pads... I couldn't believe my luck.<br><br>
							Despite being unable to repair these devices, I really gave it a good shot and did learn a whole lot. 
							I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know if maybe, just maybe, it could've worked.

                            I began my humble beginnings by grabbing and displaying the device's 
                            MAC address!<br><br>
                            Before learning how to achieve two-way communication via ESP-NOW, sending a 
                            data payload over WiFi to a hardcoded peer's address that is received and verified through 
                            callbacks.<br><br>
                            Then, a one-to-many network with a single transmitter which sends its 
                            data (on button input) to the registered remote peers, which relay the received data 
                            to a serial output.<br><br>
                            With concerns of power usage, I researched into the "deep sleep mode", 
                            which powers down a large portion of the module's functionality but requires the 
                            usage of the RTC IOs or timers to wake the device from this state.<br><br>
                            After lots of testing, improving my understanding of I2C and unpacking data packets 
                            with the help of "promiscuous mode", I figured out how to fetch accurate RSSI values!<br><br>

						<p>Wanting to build another Unity game for Android, I looked no further than the Fallout 
							minigame that I had already made so many prototypes of in the past.<br><br>
							To begin with, I started working on generating the hexadecimal row headers and "play 
							area". Followed, by implementing the highlighting and grouping methods. As each 
							symbol character needed to be accessed by a uniquely addressable "cell".<br><br>
							After finalizing my method of grouping cells, I could highlight individual row 
							headers on mouseover/touch for both desktop and mobile platforms. I had some fun 
							with placing the generated "passwords" evenly within the play area - where the 
							random amount of words had to fit within the region, without touching, and of 
							varying lengths depending on difficulty. Also attempting to limit the number of 
							wrapped words.<br><br>
							I thoroughly enjoyed designing and programming the logic for this, but the process of 
							implementing Google Play Service support, GP Leaderboards, and Unity 
							In-App-Purchases, really slowed things down. But, I'm happy to say that it's finally 
							released and can be found on the <a target="_blank" class="web-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LucHeaton.TerminalMastermind">Google Play Store</a> for free!</p>

						<p>I developed a program that sends commands via SPI to a TLC59281

						<p>Wanting to find a use for my 16x2 character display, I thought it'd be fun
							to build a single-digit calculator using too many push buttons. It worked
							by allowing you to cycle through values 0-9 (with the unlabeled pushbutton) 
							for the first digit. After confirming the first digit, do the same for the second,
							then select the operator (+,-,/,x), completing the calculation and appending
							the result to the end</p>

							sequence of LEDs while holding down a single pushbutton, changing direction 
							on re-press, and toggling state on a single press, retaining the previous state</p>

						<p>To begin my journey into the world of reading datasheets, I downloaded and started

							To fade an LED from an analogue input involved addressing and accessing the IC's data
