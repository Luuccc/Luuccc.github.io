							<p>Wanting to build another Unity game for Android, I looked no further than the Fallout minigame that I keep reprogramming.</br></br>
								To begin with, I started working on generating the hexadecimal row headers and "play area". Followed, by implementing the highlighting and grouping methods. As each symbol character
								needed to be accessed by a uniquely addressable "cell". </br></br>
								After finalizing my method of grouping cells, I could highlight individual row headers on mouseover/touch for both desktop and mobile platforms. I had some fun with placing the generated 
								"passwords" evenly within the play area, with the random amount of words all fitting, without touching. Also attempting to limit the number of wrapped words.</br></br>
								I thoroughly enjoyed designing the logic and programming this, but the process of adding Ads, Google Play Service support, GP Leaderboards, and Unity In-App-Purchases, really slowed things down. But, 
								I'm happy to say that it's finally released and can be found on the

                            <p>I was asked to produce a tester program to send commands via SPI to a TLC59281 (LED Driver), drawing to four seven-segment displays.</br></br>
								This involved building 32-bit payloads from the serial data received that specify the segments to illuminate, the colour bits, and symbol bits. 
								As well as creating a serial transfer method to send payloads to the LED driver chip.</br></br>
								Continuing this, I realized it would instead be useful to refactor my code and build a C++ library. Allowing anyone to interface with this display without needing to understand the payload.
								I also extended the functionality of the library by adding various helper methods, allowing a user to perform more actions with the display.

                                To a level of progression to the bot, I implemented a load/save system, storing data with JSON files. Doing this allowed me to create and keep track of a virtual currency, which led to the

                                unboxed item of varying quality (indicated by colouring with text syntax) within their "inventory" as JSON data. Which could then be sold, or kept.</br></br> For this bot to work, however it relied on my computer 
                                running. So naturally, I learnt how to program a Raspberry PI, and then moved the bot program onto it which I could then leave on almost 24/7.</p>

                            <p>In my first released game for Android, I designed and programmed Sweep Driveby. The aim is to swipe the junk off the road, that the vehicles continue to dump off. This earns you points, with bonus
                                points for swiping junk into the hoops! The smaller the hoop the more bonus points you will receive. The game is lost if a car collides with a piece of junk.</br></br>As I haven't kept
                                the game up-to-date with the latest Android Play Store policies, it has been removed due to its outdated usage of Ads (and everything else). For a short period of time, I provided an
                                APK version of it, but I feel it is too outdated now (although some site probably still has an APK of it, but I wouldn't trust it).</p>
