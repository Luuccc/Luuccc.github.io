						<p>Every time I review my website, I seem to notice more problems. From awful scaling 
                            to smaller resolutions, unnecessarily large media files, or my poor grammar. So 
                            with my current knowledge of things, I've spent some time making minor changes to the 
                            site, most notably to the scaling for smaller displays.<br><br>
                            At the top, you can see how the site used to scale, with elements becoming 
                            unreadable and misplaced. Below that are my changes, with elements not 
                            becoming too small. Also, hiding media files on smaller displays.</p>

							I began my humble beginnings by grabbing and displaying the device's

							I then began learning how to achieve two-way communication via ESP-NOW, sending a 
							data payload over WiFi to a hardcoded peer's address, that is received and verified through 
							callbacks.<br><br>
							Moving onto a one-to-many network, with a single transmitter sending its 
							data (on button input) to the registered remote peers that relay the received data 
							to a serial output<br><br>
							With the requirement to draw low current, I looked into the "deep sleep mode", 
							which powers down a large portion of the module's functionality, but requires the 
							usage of the RTC IOs, or timers to wake the device from this state.<br><br>
							As well as lots of testing, and figuring out how to fetch RSSI values, I 
							improved my understanding of I2C, which had a small learning curve with the ESP</p>

						<p>Wanting to understand some of the entry-level machine learning concepts, 
							I decided to recreate a project I had seen created with <a target="_blank" class="web-link" href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. 
							My goal was to create a learning algorithm that would result in AI agents 
							reaching a location with no exact knowledge of the destination (only their 
							final distance from it) and improving over time.<br><br>
							The process involved placing the agents on the scene with a maximum number of 
							steps they can take in any direction before they "die". After each agent has 
							taken all of its steps, it's given a fitness value calculated based on its 
							distance from the target location or, if reached, based on the number of steps 
							taken.<br><br>
							I then take the best-performing agents by fitness value (coloured blue) and 
							place them in the next generation with slight mutations to their movement 
							pattern, which may be for the better or worse.<br><br>
							Looking at my example above, you can see that there is a point where you reach 
							diminishing returns, with tens of generations going by and only improving by 
							a step or two. It came down to fine adjustments to the fitness algorithm, where 
							I achieved a minimum of 65 steps to reach the target over 175 generations, with 
							the actual minimum being about 60.<br><br>
							Even though it was just a surface level look into this field. I enjoyed it as a 
							small learning project.</p>

							network (as a Coordinator, Router, or End Point), was in the correct operating

							After manually setting up each module, it was possible to demonstrate their

							modules remotely if the unit was in the correct mode, but this was good enough

						<p>Wanting to build another Unity game for Android, I looked no further than the Fallout 
							minigame that I had already made so many prototypes of in the past.<br><br>
							To begin with, I started working on generating the hexadecimal row headers and "play

							symbol character needed to be accessed by a uniquely addressable "cell". <br><br>
							After finalizing my method of grouping cells, I could highlight individual row 
							headers on mouseover/touch for both desktop and mobile platforms. I had some fun 
							with placing the generated "passwords" evenly within the play area - where the 
							random amount of words had to fit within the region, without touching, and of 
							varying lengths depending on difficulty. Also attempting to limit the number of 
							wrapped words.<br><br>
							I thoroughly enjoyed designing the logic and programming this, but the process of 
							implementing Ads, Google Play Service support, GP Leaderboards, and Unity 
							In-App-Purchases, really slowed things down. But, I'm happy to say that it's finally 
							released and can be found on the <a target="_blank" class="web-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LucHeaton.TerminalMastermind">Google Play Store</a> for free!</p>

						<p>I was asked to produce a program that sent commands via SPI to a TLC59281
                            (an LED Driver) to control four seven-segment displays. This involved building 
                            32-bit payloads that specify which segments to illuminate, the colour of the LEDs, 
                            and the symbol bits. As well as the serial transfer method with the correct timing 
                            to send data to the driver chip<br><br>
                            Continuing this, I realized it would instead be useful to refactor my code and build 
                            a C++ library. Allowing anyone to interface with this display without needing to 
                            understand the payload structure. I also extended the functionality of the library by 
                            adding various helper methods, allowing a user to perform extra functions with the display.</p>
